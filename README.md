# FLOOD

After finishing my clearing algorithm for my minesweeper game, I thought I might be able apply to this to a Flood game. This is not a full game, but it works just like the original flood game did. You use the arrows to change the color selected, and then hit the 2nd key to change the board. Hopefully this demo could be used to create a full game in the near future.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
